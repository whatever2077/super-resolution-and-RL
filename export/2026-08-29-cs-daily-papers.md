- **原始摘要**: Recent prominent post-training methods, such as Reinforcement Learning (RL) and On-Policy Self-Distillation (OPSD), have driven rapid progress in mathematical reasoning for large language models, yet their reliance on ground-truth labels precludes test-time training (TTT). Replacing ground truth with majority-vote pseudo-labels is a natural alternative, yet it is fragile: an incorrect vote corrupts the teacher and misleads every token. We observe that this failure mode is asymmetric: rollouts that disagree with the pseudo-label are typically wrong regardless of whether the vote itself is correct. Building on this observation, we propose Test-Time Policy Optimization (TTPO), an asymmetric objective that distills agreeing rollouts via OPSD and penalizes disagreeing rollouts with Grouped RL. Token-level selection further refines both branches: distillation down-weights already-converged positions, while RL penalizes only confident errors. Both updates remain well-grounded even under frequent pseudo-label errors, and majority-vote routing yields tighter self-supervision as the model improves. Without any labels, TTPO matches label-supervised OPSD on five competition-level benchmarks, raises Qwen3-1.7B from 38.0% to 45.2% in TTT, yields +25.2% to +36.4% without thinking, and shows strong cross-task generalization.
